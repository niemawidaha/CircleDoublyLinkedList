# CircleDoublyLinkedList

A circular doubly-linked list
(a) In a circular doubly-linked list, there is no front or end;
the nodes form a full circle. Instead of keeping track of the node at the front, we keep track of a current node instead. 
Write a class for a circular doubly-linked list using the attached Job class as your node objects. 
It should have:
• A private instance variable for the current node

• A getCurrent() method that returns a reference to the current node • A method to insert a node before the current node

• A method to delete the current node

• A method to advance the current node to the next node in the list • A method to check whether the list is empty

• A method to print the list, starting with the current node

(b) Write tests for these methods. 
    -   Why did you choose these test cases? (Think about any edge cases as you do this.) 
    -   Did you get what you expected?
